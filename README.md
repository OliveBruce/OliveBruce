- 👋 Hi, I’m @OliviaBruce
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineer. Computers have always interested me, especially the nitty gritty side of things and digging into code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any learning opportunities for a Junior Dev. 
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me @olivia.bruce1995@gmail.com or you can find me on LinkedIn @ www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-bruce-985a442a1
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love the color teal! It finds its way into almost everything I do personally. I also love drawing, and if I can draw a silly little moment into an illustration, I will. I also love videogames! It's a goal of mine to build a game someday, even just a small one.
